/*
In JavaScript, we don't use int to declare variables, we use let or const instead

8ball is an invalid variable name because variable names cannot start with a number.

The if statement should be followed by a conditional expression, where: and {} are invalid,&lt; &gt;  Not a valid comparison operator,i++ should be in the loop

getobjectById should be getElementById,and should have Id in it.
