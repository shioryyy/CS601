      The HTML viewport is the area of a web page that is visible to the user. It is typically 
      smaller than the actual size of the page, and can be resized by the user using the browser's 
      scrollbars. The viewport is important for responsive web design, as it allows web pages to be 
      displayed correctly on a variety of devices with different screen sizes.

      The HTML viewport is controlled by the <meta> viewport tag, which can be placed in the 
      head of the HTML document. The tag has a number of properties that can be used to control 
      the size, scaling, and orientation of the viewport. Some of the most common properties are:

        width:         This property sets the width of the viewport in pixels.
        initial-scale: This property sets the initial zoom level of the viewport.
        maximum-scale: This property sets the maximum zoom level of the viewport.
        minimum-scale: This property sets the minimum zoom level of the viewport.
        user-scalable: This property indicates whether the user can scale the viewport using 
                       the browser's scrollbars.
        
        The HTML viewport is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the user experience of 
        your web pages. By carefully controlling the viewport, you can ensure that your pages 
        are displayed correctly on a variety of devices, regardless of their screen size or 
        orientation.

            I like singing very much. Whenever I have free time, I sing some of my favorite songs. I like all types of music, from pop to classical. I also like to try different singing techniques and styles. Singing makes me feel relaxed and helps me release stress. I also like to sing with my friends and we often go to karaoke together.

            Dancing is another big passion of mine. I love all types of dance, from street dance to ballet. I regularly attend dance classes to improve my dancing skills. Dancing not only keeps me fit but also makes me happy. I like to express my emotions in dance and I also like to watch other people dance and get inspiration from their dances.

          <p class="hobby-description">
            I also really like rap. I love the beats and rhymes of rap and I love the depth and meaning of rap lyrics. I often write my own rap lyrics at home and experiment with different genres and styles. I also like to listen to a variety of different rap artists and get inspiration from their music. Rap is a form of self-expression and an art form for me.
